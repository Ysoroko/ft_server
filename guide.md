### This is the complete step-by-step guide to complete ft_server (2021) project for 42 coding schools network.
<br />

## Prerequisites:
#### - üìö You are familiar with all of the concepts and tools needed for this project: containers, images, ports, MariaDB, Wordpress, phpMyAdmin etc.
#### - üê≥ You have Docker installed on your computer and it is running ([**download link**](https://www.docker.com/get-started))
<br />

## Project parts breakdown:
#### 1) Create a Dockerfile and download a Debian Buster image  
#### 2) Install all of the dependancies needed for the rest of the project
#### 3) Install and configure NGINX
#### 4) Install and configure phpMyAdmin
#### 5) Install and configure Wordpress
#### 6) Generate a SSL certificate and apply it
<br />

## Building, running and cleaning up your containers:
#### Throughout this project you will often need to test your work. The following commands are used *A LOT* and I recommend to create a Makefile with rules that will execute them for you
#### `docker build -t ft_server .` will build our Docker container and name it "ft_server"
#### `docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 -p 443:443 ft_server` After it's built this command will:
  * `run` *run* our container
  * `-it` in the terminal mode (we will be able to execute the commands inside the image from our terminal)
  * `--rm` automatically remove it once it's stopped
  * `-p` link the necessary ports (80 and 443)
  * And finally, name it "ft_server"
#### `docker rmi $(docker images -q)` will remove all the images previously downloaded in Docker
#### `docker rm $(docker ps -qa)` will remove all the built containers
#### `docker system prune` will cleanup the temporary files and the rest of remaining used space
<br />

## 1) Create a Dockerfile and download a Debian Buster image
All you need to do is:
* Create a file called Dockerfile
* Add a line `FROM debian:buster` inside.
* Add lines `RUN apt-get update` and `RUN apt-get upgrade -y`
<br />
Dockerfile is like a Makefile, but instead of executing commands in your terminal it will do it inside Docker images.

The command `FROM` tells Docker to download the image that follows and use the commands we'll add in the next step inside this image.

Here we are using an empty Debian Buster operating system image as asked in the subject. You can imagine that we download an empty Windows or MacOS now and
in the next step we will start installing the dependencies needed for the rest of our project.

Before we do that, we need to update the Debian Buster packages to make sure everything is up to date just as we need.
This is simply done by adding `RUN apt-get update` and `RUN apt-get upgrade -y` to our Dockerfile. 

`RUN` is used in Dockerfile to execute the command inside the window, as if it is entered in the terminal of our Debian OS.

<br />

```Dockerfile
#------------------ 1. Create a Dockerfile and download Debian Buster image ---------------------
# Download debian:buster from Docker and use it as main image here
FROM debian:buster

# Update Debian Buster packages
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get upgrade -y
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Now if we try to build our docker image and run it, Debian Buster image will be downloaded from Docker and it will be updated.

<br />

## 2) Install all of the dependancies needed to install the rest of the tools
Now that we have our Dockerfile and an empty Debian OS with basic packages, we will install the dependencies and tools needed for further steps in the project.

This is adding several `apt-get install` to our Dockerfile. For this project there are several things we need:
```Dockerfile
#----------------------------------- 2. Intall Dependencies --------------------------------------
# Sysvinit-utils for "service" command used to easaily restart out nginx after updating
RUN apt-get install sysvinit-utils

# Wget is used to easily download phpMyAdmin / Wordpress
RUN apt-get -y install wget

# Nginx is an open source web server tool we are going to use to connect our Docker container image to our webpage
RUN apt-get -y install nginx

# MariaDB is a tool used to manage databases. It's a community "fork" of MySQL (= improved version of MySQL)
RUN apt-get -y install mariadb-server

# Php packages are needed to read our configuration files and properly connect all of our components together
# In case a php package is missing, we will get an error when launching php related services later
RUN apt-get -y install php-cgi php-common php-fpm php-pear php-mbstring
RUN php-zip php-net-socket php-gd php-xml-util php-gettext php-mysql php-bcmath
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Now if we try to build our docker image and run it, it downloads/updates Debian Buster and also downloads all of the dependencies we need.
